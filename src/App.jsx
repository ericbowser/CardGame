/**
 * Main App component that establishes the context provider
 *
 * The key change here is wrapping everything in GameProvider.
 * This makes all our centralized state available to every component
 * in the application tree. Think of this as installing the "nervous system"
 * that allows all parts of your app to communicate.
 *
 * This pattern is called "Lifting State Up" - we've moved all state
 * to the highest level where it can be shared by all components that need it.
